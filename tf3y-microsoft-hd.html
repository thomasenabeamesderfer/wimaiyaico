                            <p> So our team is using the camera Microsoft HD 3000 and it used to work with just the line (CameraServer.launch()) but it is not working anymore. (We are using python 
Hi, I just recently built a new pc and I'm using an MSI MPG Z390M motherboard. I'd like to ask if there are any real benefits (mainly concerning sound quality) of installing the Realtek HD Audio drivers recommended by MSI, or if I can just stick to the Microsoft driver ? It might just be my mind playing tricks on me, but sound quality seemed to be better with the Microsoft drivers. Realtek HD Audio hasn't been working with Windows 10 when using headphones so I switched to Microsoft HD Audio through the Device Manager. I am curious if there are any downsides to this. I tried fixing Realtek, but had no luck and don't want to continue struggling to fix it if Microsoft HD Audio is equally as good. I don't produce any music just want solid audio quality when using headphones. I retired my Lumia 950 recently and I still have the hd-500 display dock that came with it. Can I do anything interesting with this. I see some weird videos where people have used it with a select few android phones, but otherwise am not sure if it's good for anything besides continuum and several surface pro models supposedly could use it. If I just left it all hooked up to a screen, the lumia technically can be used as media machine for videos and streaming, but I simply have far better. I love ShootOff! I just got started a few days ago and bought a projector yesterday, just for ShootOff. Thanks so much for all the work that was put into making this app. I have a Macbook Pro Retina and run Windows 7 inside Parallels. I get 30 fps when running but there is some lag between shot recognition. I would like to run ShootOff natively in High Sierra, but I only get 9-10 fps when I do. I ran in debug mode and see the following message, which I assume has something As a relatively new L950XL (fast insider) user after having a L640 for a year and a half, I would like to try Continuum, but I don't feel like paying the premium price for it. For some reason I cannot use Continuum on my laptop. After (or during?) connecting, the laptop (Lenovo Y700 series on Win10CU) gives me an error that it cannot show protected content, even though I haven't even seen the start menu or the Continuum desktop yet). I have tried a bit and haven't been able to get through Hi guys, i´m using the Microsoft Hd 3000 Webcam. I know it´s not the best webcam but for my start it is decent enough. Just one question. Is there any chance to zoom out? If i add the webcam to obs, the picture is too near at my face and with the properties i can just zoom in. The cam is clipped on my screen, so there is no chance to put the cam itself more far away. Anyone has an idea to get the zoom out? Maybe a filter in obs or something. It's very painful to switch display dock,mouse and keyboard from my surface and jump from surface to phone continuum and vice-versa. I'm thinking in buying a HD-10 hub/set for my Lumia 640 but i want to share it with my dad too, and he may use it more then me. My question is: does HD-10 work with my dad's tablet since it's a Samsung Galaxy 
Or While watching any videos online, after a couple of minutes the audio will start to be ahead of the video itself. The issues does not occur on watching offline videos, only online regardless of source (Chrome, Opera, Edge, Netflix App) I've tried reinstalling Realtek Audio Drivers, Did not work. Tried switching to Microsoft HD Audio Drivers, The desync starts a bit later. Plugging my headset (Logitech G430 with the USB Driver) and using it will not have any desync. The issue start. So i just got done chatting with Creative's live customer support and was informed that those of us who own X-Fi Titanium HD's will NOT be receiving an updated driver even though we bought newer, and much more expensive cards than the normal X-Fi which DID get a driver update. It's a shame really. I was really looking forward to buying the AE-9 once it is released but if this is going to be how they treat their top end card customers, i'll spend my money elsewhere. And this is coming from someon. So I’ve been wanting to revisit the original XBOX and find a bunch of 4 player split screen games to play with my kids Found an OG Xbox on Craigslist with some controllers and Halo 1 and 2 and assorted other games Took it apart, had to repair the dvd drive rubber band that was slipping and not ejecting tray but that’s all set now. Unit looks nice and clean and runs great I have identified it as a version 1.6, so I don’t have to worry about the clock capacitor Before 
After a clean windows install on my 9380, I noticed that when I muted and turned the sound back on, there was a pop on the speaker. So I tried a clean install again and with the Microsoft HD Drivers that do not happen, but as soon as I install the Realtek drivers the issue begins. I have everything up-to-date, even the bios. After I've installed the realtek drivers I cannot roll back to the microsoft ones, they simply don't work anymore. I also tried some tricks to do not let the windows update. Does any of you have a Dell Latitude 5590 with Windows 10 Pro 1809? If yes do you have this cracking sound problem? I tried everything I found on Google, but I'm not able to replace the Realtek driver with the Microsoft HD Audio driver. No matter what I do, after the restart the Realtek Audio driver is installed by Windows and cracking sound is constantly there. I have to know if others have this problem or is a warranty case. The problem is not just the cracking sound, when I play MKV files. I've just noticed today that I have no audio full stop. There is no audio through my speakers and no audio through my monitor. I notice that others have had a problem with a specific device not working since the 1809 update but this isn't just my Soundblaster Z, this is my monitor speakers as well. Windows appears to be just not producing audio at all. Nothing is muted, everything is as it was before, I just have no sound. Tried a reboot, tried installing new sound card drivers. 
I am looking for games like these of Zelda, Mario, etc. \ You can suggest them, but with specific names please\  I'm looking for something 3D, I don't mind if it's on PS1/PS2/Nintendo etc. I'm just looking for some chilling. Have to say it's so magical. I wanted to present some pics I had open in Edge to the TV screen while being on a visit somewhere. The TV was a modern LG with WebOS. I opened screen sharing on the TV and connected to a wireless display on phone and done. There it was. Win10. Wow. Everything worked as it should. And everything I had open on my phone was now visible on the 60" screen. I know I don't really have an extra story to this but as a fan using a Lumia 950 this felt so weird, great </p>
