Thanks С помощью GiliSoft Secure Disc Creator можно записать защищенный паролем и зашифрованный диск.  I have an old array of disks in software RAID 5 on /dev/md0. I want to erase all the data from the disks before I give them away. I did this: gt\# openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2gt/dev/null base64)" -nosalt lt /dev/zero gt /dev/md0 The idea here is to generate a key using some data from /dev/urandom and use that key to generate a stream of aes-256 encrypted data, which should be faster than just reading /dev/urandom directly (albeit SafeIT Digital Secure Disk, скачать бесплатно.

Last night when I powered down my laptop it gave an error saying something like "failed to disassemble cache." I was in a hurry, so I just turned it off. This morning my laptop refuses to start. Xubuntu boots into a black screen, and recovery mode boots into the picture. Is there any way I can fix this without reinstalling? Thank you. Edit: ThinkPad T430 Xubuntu 19.04 https://mega.nz/#!FM4xjKRL!iI7QNzT1_sjF6Z3R2aKRUcxFuKBPY2-JmaRaECMqBB0. Happy read-only, everyone! amp#x200B; I've been tasked with recycling a large number of old laptops, and was wondering if any of you have good methods or software recommendations for wiping Laptops with m.2 and embeded SSD's. I am working with Lenovo Thinkpads. amp#x200B; I dont really have the option to pull the drives, and I think some of the carbons have soldered on drives anyways. Ideally, I would prefer to leave windows intact as we will probably try to sell them to offset I'm a long time windows user, wanting to install Ubuntu on a separate partition. I created a USB to install from, when restarting my computer I hit f11 to open the boot menu. I select the USB drive and hit enter. I see a Ubuntu splash with dots that change from white to red and back underneath where it says Ubuntu. Then it goes black screen. Any ideas what I should. 
I installed Ubuntu (dual booted with win10) following this video link (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u5QyjHIYwTQ). Everything went well but when I rebooted it led me straight to windows rather than giving me the option to select which is I want to use so I googled and found this article link (https://itsfoss.com/no-grub-windows-linux/). So I entered the command , rebooted again. Only to find this error error image (https://i.vgy.me/0csz0p.jpg) I (probably) know WHAT I need to do but I can't. My pc has been freezing for about 15 seconds at a time quite regularly after i built it maybe 5 months ago or so. I dont think my cpu is the problem as its quite powerful (i5 8600k) and it never gets to 100% usage. I also have 16gb of corsair ram and a 1070 ti but neither of them seem to be the problem either. I think the problem is software related bit i cant put my finger on where it is or how to fix it. If anyone can help i would greatly appreciate. For example the Data Traveler 2000? Or can anyone recommend me a more secure option? I am using Mac if that matters and I have to say that I am a complete layman with technology. It should be very secure because I want to save all my important documents/files and a code for my btc wallet on it. On a scale of 1-10 how secure is it? 1 being secure from an everyday person and 10 being the government or very well versed hacker. Recently our flat was burgled and my girlfriend's Macbook was stolen, but we eventually recovered it after seeing it posted for sale on Facebook. This was possible because it has a fixed serial number visible in software and etched on the chassis, which is also present on the box and purchase receipt so the police accepted it as evidence of ownership. (I took photos of the laptop when visiting as a buyer, and also set the firmware password so they couldn't wipe it) This likely wouldn't I have some FDE disks which I don't even have the password for anymore because I lost them. I was wondering what would happen if for some reason I was forced to unencrypt those drives by authorities and I told the truth (that I don't remember the passwords). Probably nothing good as they would interpret this as not cooperating with authorities. Im not US based but the laws are becoming worse and worse and losing your pass seems like one way ticket to jail. I think we have lost. there's So there are a lot of information out there about how wiping SSDs isn't the same as wiping spinning drives due to stale data and reserved space below the flash translation layer (FTL). The fallacy that I fell into is that since traditional file utilities such as shred are "ineffective" on SSDs, there is no point in using them, and I could not be more wrong. Sorry if this is obvious, but hopefully this will help someone in the same situation. But first, let me take a detour on the automatic. Hey, r/windows. My dad is desperately trying to install Windows 7 on my Windows 10 computer as he thinks that Windows 10 is a total piece of crap and Windows 7 is the best. The thing is, that I'd like to stay with Windows 10. Is there any way to block installing another operating system? No, talking to him doesn't do ANYTHING. I know this sounds funny, but please help me. Excuse my poor English, please. I'm in the process of returning around 100 Windows machines to our supplier for the end of the month as their leases have terminated, and I need to wipe each drive in the machines. In the past we've used DBAN (off of a CD) to wipe the machines, but our drives are now all NVMe drives, and DBAN can't access them. Not looking to brick the drives, as they need to "work" when our suppliers receive them, just looking to zero them out. Drive Model: NVMe SAMSUNG MZVPV256 SCSI Disk Device Ideally. 
I'd like to wipe a hard disk; it's starting to sound cranky, so I'm replacing it. How do I go about wiping everything? Disk Utility says it can do it, but it takes under a minute; that sounds like the directory is wiped but the rest of the disk remains, errr, normal. What's the best way of removing everything short of an acid bath, thermonuclear war, or a severe talking-to. </p>
