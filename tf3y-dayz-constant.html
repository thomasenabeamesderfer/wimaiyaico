                            <p> Has anyone else had a disconnection problem regardless of what server they are playing on? I enjoy dayz very much but since last week my client has been disconnecting every 20-30 minutes making it rather hard to play. Just wondering if anyone has any idea on what the problem could be or, with luck, if there are any known fixes. Unfortunately my google searching has left me with no more answers then when I started, so any help would be much appreciated. Anyway, happy hunting and thanks Having to honk to find people after you leave the place you landed is not the way we should play :/ Like seriously 6 mins ??? Imo they should halve that other then that the game is great. 
I’m not a pc player (playing dayz on Xbox) but I recognized a lot of scum comments and posts in the last months but lately there is not much new to hear. I’m just curious if it’s a replacement for dayz or just like the others not a real replacement This servers i hope they will not crash like that at release or peoples would leave instantly. A FUCKING MILLION COPIES HAVE BEEN SOLD ALREADY AND YET THE PEOPLE MAKING IT CAN'T EVEN HIRE DECENT GAME DEVELOPERS WHO CAN OPTIMIZE THAT SHIT? MAN GET OFF OF MY FUCKING LAWN. GAMEPLAY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT THE GAME ISN'T A SIDE-PROJECT MADE BY A LAZY COLLEGE GAME DEV ON A TIGHT DEADLINE. THE GAME IS A MESS AND PEOPLE SHOULD STOP PUTTING THE BLAME ON CONSOLES/PCS BECAUSE THE GAME ITSELF IS INHERENTLY. Are there any promo codes floating around for the game? Got a shock when purchasing and tax isn't included in the price. Heard mixed reviews on the game, is it worth 
BlkDragons dayz server PVE. PVP only in electro and cherno. 108.245.167.198:2302 TS info is BlkDragonsTS. I've played on experimental in the past, sure, but not as heavily as I have with this patch. I am really enjoying the activity all over the map, so I haven't gone back to stable. However, one of the things I appreciate most about playing on experimental are the regular iterations patching small things. It only took a few days to send out a fix for the naked players past 200m bug, as well as gunshots being silent. Of course, there are still some prevalent bugs causing problems (zombies being. I would get into a server and play for around 30 - 45 seconds on ANY server (official or community) and then i would get a black screen and dayz would close and put me back to desktop. I've already verified game files and it hasn't helped, anyone elses getting. Hey guys, i dont know if you know the game called "Onward" for the HTC Vive (and soon Oculus with Touch) VR system? How hard would it be for BIS to create this experience for ArmA 3 or DayZ? And i am not talking about a seated experience, with just your headset and still use the keyboard. I am talking about FULL VR experience. Standing in your room, moving your body and use your hands to aim and shoot. Before i talk on, just watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS3Vi4Cipgk. There have been constant updates on Steamdb (Which has most likely been an error that the team was fixing because of the constant back and forth between the numbers 26 and 27) and there are 15 players on the server, and rising?? Let's hear some theories. http://steamdb.info/sub/492/#section_apps. 
Been gone a few months and there are almost no players online. Worth the wait, boys. Worth the wait. I used to come to this subreddit for hours everyday, I used to enjoy the discussions, the updates from Rocket and all the player stories. Recently however I've stopped coming here completely, there is no meaningful content, the only stuff people post here now is their YouTube videos. We need a DayZVideos subbreddit or try only allowing text posts for a week or maybe just make the criteria for posting videos a little stricter. All this subreddit has become is a place for people to spam their. Weasel: Okay iWeasel: Ready Dayz! iWeasel: Come discord ♥Action♥: later ♥Action♥: xxxx ♥Action♥: Ordering pizza now ♥Action♥: been playing video games for hours iWeasel: NWAF and Pizza is the new Netflix and chill ♥Action♥:. DayZ and Arma II: DayZ are the only Bohemia games I have played. I have heard and seen some really cool stuff with Arma3 and the vast amount of mods the game has. I was just curious if anyone (who has played out both the popular mods and DayZ) could tell me how they stack up against each other in terms of features. What does DayZ currently do better than the mods (Breaking Point, Exile, DayZ Arma3) and vice versa. EDIT: Just played Breaking Point. I have to say that I had expected Hi, i'm oral (steam:OmgitsOralB) and i'm looking for ages 15+ to play with, English speaking and can be serious but have fun at the same time. Add me if interested. </p>
